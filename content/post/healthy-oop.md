I enjoy writing code in an Object Oriented fashion. Thinking in terms of objects gives me
a model that, when followed consistently, ends up giving me code that is well organised,
and that I know to be easy to understand, test and refactor.

Now [some people](https://mcollina.github.io/we-are-not-object-oriented-anymore/
) would want to argue that OOP doesn't really work and/or that we don't need it anymore
to build modern software, and why I by no means think or want to say that OOP is the ultimate
paradigm, I would definitely want to maintain that *it is* helpful and that no, a bunch of
procedural code *is not* the answer.

The problem with a lot of the criticism that OOP gets, is that it tends to refer to things that in
popular programmer culture have become somehow associated with OOP, while that isn't really the case.

Object Oriented Programming done well, or what I call **Healthy OOP*, comes with a lot of benefits.
