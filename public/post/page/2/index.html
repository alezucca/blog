    <p>As I am in the middle of reading the excellent [Building Microservices][1] from Sam Newman, I thought I would spend some time de-mistyfying what <strong>Microservices</strong> are, when/if are they needed and why.</p>

<p>I am really grateful to this book, which I warmly recommend, for finally making the concept of Microservices so easy for me to understand, while never standing back from actually going into the difficulties of the practical world, with several real-life advices on how to make Microservices work in a modern architecture.&hellip;</p>

    <p>After reading [levels.io][1]&#8216;s latest brilliantly written [article][2], I started thinking about a future, as suggested by the article, of massive corporations on one hand and billions of self employed individuals on the other.</p>

<p>Now of course, one need not be a financial analyst to see that companies like Amazon, Google and Apple are going to &#8220;rule the world&#8221; in many ways in the near future (in a sense, they already do). We all accept that. And looking at, for example, the amount of pressure that these companies are able to put on their governments, one also wonders what the future of politics will look like.&hellip;</p>

    <p>I have been recently studying and trying [Go]<a href="Golang">1</a>, a statically typed language developed by Google, which promises really fast execution times and a pleasant development experience.</p>

<p>I must say, it is pleasant to use indeed. And quite simple to learn. But it does also demolish some of the things that, coming from other languages, you might be giving for granted. While trying to get my head around it, it felt a lot like when I was trying to learn proper Javascript (i.e. <em>beyond</em> jQuery), that is, it can sometimes take a while to understand, but then at one point something &#8216;clicks&#8217;, and immediately everything becomes so clear and easy. You do not end up necessarily thinking that it is <em>the best language ever</em>, but you do come to appreciate its design choices.&hellip;</p>

    <p>I have been struggling for a while with finding the right CMS and/or publishing platform. All of them seem to have good parts and less good parts, and that is okay. In a (possible, potential) future attempt of myself to try building the <em>right</em> publishing platform, I have decided to list some of the things that it seems to me people would usually look for in a CMS or a blogging platform. I would like as many people as possible to select in the poll below what are the things that would make them choose a publishing platform over another.&hellip;</p>

    <p>And so here we are. After less than a year of marriage, my wife and I are relocating to a new Country.</p>

<p>We have been living in Milan, Italy since we got married, and, I will admit, we have loved the city. Milan is, as I often say, the Italian idea of what a metropolis would be. While it has all the characteristics of a modern European city, it is also very, very Italian. It is a city definitely worth visiting and a lovely place to work and live in.&hellip;</p>

<p>Every good framework should allow you to easily create/execute commands from the [command line]<a href="also called _shell_ or _terminal_">1</a>.</p>

<p>The command line is incredibly helpful and in some cases (e.g. when executing <em>cron jobs</em> or particularly big scripts that make extensive use of your server&#8217;s resources) simply unavoidable.&hellip;</p>

    <p>I have recently written a couple of articles for Milk &amp; Honey Mag, which is a lifestyle magazine for women. The articles that I have written for them so far are: Chromebook from Google: smaller than a laptop, more useful than a tablet Here I try to give an overview of what a Chromebook is, and what are the differences between it and the devices that everyone already knows (laptops, tablets, etc.).&hellip;</p>

    <p>I am definitely amongst the growing group of developers that are fascinated and thrilled by [node.js][1], its thriving community, its being simple yet powerful, super-fast and scalable.</p>

<p>Although my main language remains [PHP]<a href="mostly because my employer wants me to work with it, but also because of its enormous libraries collection and its maturity as a language for the web">2</a>, I can undoubtedly see a future with most of the cool apps out there being developed with node.js. I am convinced that, should I start a new project of my own today, a project that I believed would conquer the market, I would totally go for a lightweight HTML5 + CSS3 + JS (with the help of [Angular.js][3]) interface backed by a powerful node.js (with [express.js][4])-based API.&hellip;</p>
