# The right tools for the job

Hardly any job can be done without the right tools. You always need some-*thing* to do what you do. From the dentist to the photographer, from the journalist to the mathematician. And of course the software engineer is not excused.

Give an old, cheap, faulty camera to a great photographer, and he'll come back at you tired and frustrated, with a few nice photos and more bad ones than it would be acceptable from a professional. Give a fantastic camera to a decent photographer who knows how to use it, and he'll come back with many good photos, a few amazing ones, and perhaps a couple not-so-good.

That's why I'm always amazed at how many, both software engineers and employers, tend to overlook the importance of using the right tools.
