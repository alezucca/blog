  <div class="entry-content">
    I enjoy writing code in an Object Oriented fashion. Thinking in terms of objects gives me a model that, when followed consistently, ends up giving me code that is well organised, and that I know to be relatively easy to understand, test and refactor. Now some people would want to argue that OOP doesn&rsquo;t really work and/or that we don&rsquo;t need it anymore to build modern software, and why I by no means think or want to say that OOP is the ultimate paradigm, I would definitely want to maintain that it is helpful and that no, a bunch of procedural code, however nicely organised (even if that means microservices), is not the answer.

    If you&#8217;ve read some of my previous posts, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;m fairly excited about microservices. No, I do not believe them to be the answer to all of software development problems, but yes, they can be one of the answers to some of the problems we face. I say that and I mean it. Who doesn&#8217;t want to be able to rewrite a critical part of an application in two weeks or less?

    <p>Amongst software engineers, there is this thing called <em>technical debt</em> that is very often talked about and that tends to have somewhat of an ethereal nature.</p>

<p>Almost every company will have the technical debt prophet who will try to convince her people that doing what &#8220;feels good&#8221; now is not going to pay off down the line, and that &#8220;future generations&#8221; will have to pay for it. But, almost inevitably, choices will be made that will inescapably lead to some degree of technical debt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello Marco,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just stumbled upon your articles about microservices. I&#8217;m really trying to get into it, I find it a really interesting approach when it comes to build web apps. I got bored with all those frameworks claiming MVC etc. What I want to focus on is SOC, so microservices really fits in there. However I didn&#8217;t have time yet to practice what I could have read on that, and there are still things that are pretty obscure to me, maybe you could give me your point of view.</p>

    <p>I have been using [Periscope][1] for a while now, and I am really enjoying it. If you don&#8217;t know it, Periscope is Twitter&#8217;s new live streaming app, that allows anyone to stream directly from one&#8217;s smartphone, and it will notify you as soon as someone you follow is live-streaming.</p>

<p>The concept of live streaming is not a new one, but Periscope (alongside with their competitor, [Meerkat][2]) has made it really easy to do so from a mobile device and, most importantly, to create a community of followers around it.</p>

    <p>In today&#8217;s article, I would like to talk about something which I see that, sometimes, developers aren&#8217;t too familiar with. Most of us know what the traditional concept of <strong>inheritance</strong> is: a child class extends a parent class. And, obviously, multiple children classes can extend the same parent class.</p>

<p>What some developers don&#8217;t seem to be always aware of (or, perhaps, they just aren&#8217;t entirely sure how to use it), is the idea of <strong>composition</strong>.</p>

    <p>Have we not all been there? You&#8217;re struggling to concentrate, the task you are working on is either too boring or too tricky, and you just can&#8217;t seem to go ahead. All you want, after all, is to finish this stuff and move on to the next task.</p>

<p>Our job is very much brain-dependent. We rarely find ourselves just doing mechanical stuff which doesn&#8217;t really require us to put any thought into it. Usually, what we do requires us to do things like pre-analysis, tracing down the cause of an issue, keeping up with several trains of thought at the same time, etc.</p>

<p>Now of course, one need not be a financial analyst to see that companies like Amazon, Google and Apple are going to &#8220;rule the world&#8221; in many ways in the near future (in a sense, they already do).

    <p>I have recently been studying and trying [Go]<a href="Golang">1</a>, a statically typed language developed by Google, which promises really fast execution times and a pleasant development experience.</p>

<p>I must say, it is pleasant to use indeed. And quite simple to learn. But it does also demolish some of the things that, coming from other languages, you might be giving for granted. While trying to get my head around it, it felt a lot like when I was trying to learn proper Javascript (i.e. <em>beyond</em> jQuery), that is, it can sometimes take a while to understand, but then at one point something &#8216;clicks&#8217;, and immediately everything becomes so clear and easy. You do not end up necessarily thinking that it is <em>the best language ever</em>, but you do come to appreciate its design choices.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I have been struggling for a while with finding the right CMS and/or publishing platform. All of them seem to have good parts and less good parts, and that is okay. In a (possible, potential) future attempt of myself to try building the <em>right</em> publishing platform, I have decided to list some of the things that it seems to me people would usually look for in a CMS or a blogging platform. I would like as many people as possible to select in the poll below what are the things that would make them choose a publishing platform over another.</p>

    <p>And so here we are. After less than a year of marriage, my wife and I are relocating to a new Country.</p>

<p>We have been living in Milan, Italy since we got married, and, I will admit, we have loved the city. Milan is, as I often say, the Italian idea of what a metropolis would be. While it has all the characteristics of a modern European city, it is also very, very Italian. It is a city definitely worth visiting and a lovely place to work and live in.</p>

<p>Every good framework should allow you to easily create/execute commands from the [command line]<a href="also called _shell_ or _terminal_">1</a>.</p>

<p>The command line is incredibly helpful and in some cases (e.g. when executing <em>cron jobs</em> or particularly big scripts that make extensive use of your server&#8217;s resources) simply unavoidable.</p>

    I have recently written a couple of articles for Milk &amp; Honey Mag, which is a lifestyle magazine for women. The articles that I have written for them so far are: Chromebook from Google: smaller than a laptop, more useful than a tablet Here I try to give an overview of what a Chromebook is, and what are the differences between it and the devices that everyone already knows (laptops, tablets, etc.).

    <p>I am definitely amongst the growing group of developers that are fascinated and thrilled by [node.js][1], its thriving community, its being simple yet powerful, super-fast and scalable.</p>

<p>Although my main language remains [PHP]<a href="mostly because my employer wants me to work with it, but also because of its enormous libraries collection and its maturity as a language for the web">2</a>, I can undoubtedly see a future with most of the cool apps out there being developed with node.js. I am convinced that, should I start a new project of my own today, a project that I believed would conquer the market, I would totally go for a lightweight HTML5 + CSS3 + JS (with the help of [Angular.js][3]) interface backed by a powerful node.js (with [express.js][4])-based API.</p>

    As I needed to create some custom XMLs for a project I am working on, I have created an Yii extension based on a nice class being developed by Simon Willison. Using this extension, everyone will be easily able to generate an XML. I am pretty sure there may be different and even more powerful approaches to do the same thing, but what I like of this extension is that it does make really simple to create a custom XML.

    <p>It&#8217;s about a month ago that I came to know that <a href="http://www.larryullman.com" target="_blank">Larry Ullman</a>, a web programmer and writer of wonderful tutorials/books, was about to write a <a href="http://www.larryullman.com/2012/09/12/yii-2-and-the-yii-book/" target="_blank">new book</a> on the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com" target="_blank">Yii framework</a>, my favourite PHP framework at all.</p>

<p>While there&#8217;s no doubt I will be one of the firsts to buy it, I suggest to everyone interested in (and/or actually involved with) programming with PHP and using a framework to make your webapps more stable, simple to keep updated (especially if you work with a team) and stable, to read Larry&#8217;s incredibly clear and well written &#8220;<a href="http://www.larryullman.com/series/learning-the-yii-framework/" target="_blank">Learning Yii framework</a>&#8221; series on his blog. Should you like it, you may consider to buy his next to be published book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So I want to start my blog with one of the arguments that have thrilled me in recent times more than anything else in the programming world: the web app vs native app thing. We&#8217;re obviously focusing our attention on mobile platforms, as no one need someone explaining how much better it is to develop web-based apps for desktop than native ones. Software companies just shifted their efforts from <em>native/only one OS compatible/hard to keep updated/too much influenced by local machine performances</em> apps to the web (especially after that wonderful browser called Firefox came and thaught to Microsoft and friends how a decent browser should work -a lesson they still seem not to have learnt); and, in my memory, that shift began from the years <sup>2006</sup>&frasl;<sub>07</sub> on.</p>
